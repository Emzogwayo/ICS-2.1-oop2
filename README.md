## Project Structure

### Introductory Java Challenges
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Greeter.java` | Simple class that prints a greeting. |
| `Variables.java` | Demonstrates use of variables and interest calculation. |
| `InputExample.java` | Takes user input and displays a message. |
| `Grader.java` | Uses if-else logic to assign grades. |
| `HelloTillStop.java` | Repeats "Hello" while user inputs `h`. |

---

### Arrays Practice
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ArrayChallenge.java` | Filters specific values from an array. |
| `ArraySortReverse.java` | Sorts and reverses a string array. |
| `ArrayClearDemo.java` | Demonstrates clearing array elements. |
| `OrderIDGenerator.java` | Generates 10 random Order IDs. |

---

### Object-Oriented Design – Mini System
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Account.java`, `Admin.java`, `User.java` | Core classes with inheritance and role logic. |
| `Delete.java`, `Update.java`, `View.java` | CRUD functionality simulation. |
| `MainApplication.java` | Entry point for the mini system. |
| `DataSource.java` | Simulated data storage class. |

---

### Abstract Classes & Interfaces
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ArithmeticJava.java` | Performs basic arithmetic operations. |
| `Factorial.java` | Calculates factorials with loops. |
| `FileProcessor.java` | Reads and processes input from a file. |

---

### SOLID Principles (Each in its Own Folder)
| Folder | Principle |
|--------|-----------|
| `Single_Responsibility_Principle` | Focuses on single responsibility per class. |
| `OpenClosed_Principle` | Demonstrates open for extension, closed for modification. |
| `Liskov_Substitution_Principle` | Shows substitutability with inheritance. |
| `Interface_Segregation_Principle` | Encourages small, specific interfaces. |
| `Dependency_Inversion_Principle` | Demonstrates abstraction over concrete implementation. |
